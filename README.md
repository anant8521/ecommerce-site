# ecommerce-site
A lightweight, fully client‑side online store built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript — no build tools or backend required.

Features
1. Dynamic product grid rendered from a single JSON/JS file.
2. Shopping cart with add/remove, quantity adjustment & total price.
3. Search & category filters.

Usage
1. Browse products and click Add to Cart.
2. Hit the cart icon to review items, adjust quantities, or remove products.
3. Press Checkout to simulate a purchase – the cart clears and a success modal appears.

Tip: Cart state is stored in localStorage, so it survives page reloads.
